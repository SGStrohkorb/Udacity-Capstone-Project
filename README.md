### Software
The software is split into four jupyter notebooks and two python file. The python files are used for visualization in one of the jupyter notebooks. The three jupyter notebooks are structured such that Web_get is at the bottom, Model is in the middle, and Udacity Capstone Project is at the top. This structure allows for better code organization. They use the 'ipynb' module to get one jupyter notebook to import another. The fourth jupyter notebook is the Result Collection. Running this will generate all of the results from the models.

The final report is written in Latex. All supporting files exist within the directory.

By running the 'update' function in the Model jupyter notebook, all of the data will be collected from The Blue Alliance and processed accordingly. This will take upwards of 20 minutes.

All results are recorded in the results directory and other supporting graphics are in the main directory. These graphics can be generated by running the Udacity Capstone Project and Result Collection jupyter notebooks.
### Required Libraries
Python 3.4 or later

ipynb, matplotlib, sklearn, tqdm, numpy, pandas, xgboost, urllib3, json, os, and warnings

The most recent versions of these modules will work
