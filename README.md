### Software
The software is split into four jupyter notebooks and two python file. The python files are used for visualization in one of the jupyter notebooks. The three jupyter notebooks are structured such that Web_get is at the bottom, Model is in the middle, and Udacity Capstone Project is at the top. This structure allows for better code organization. They use the 'ipynb' module to get one jupyter notebook to import another. By running the code in Udacity Capstone Project or Result Collection, the data from The Blue Alliance will automatically be downloaded and processed if it hasn't been already. This can be forced through the 'update' function in Model. The fourth jupyter notebook is the Result Collection. Running this will generate all of the results from the models.

The final report is written in Latex. All supporting files exist within the directory.

All results are recorded in the results directory and other supporting graphics are in the main directory. These graphics can be generated by running the Udacity Capstone Project and Result Collection jupyter notebooks.
### Required Libraries
Python 3.4 or later

ipynb, matplotlib, sklearn, tqdm, numpy, pandas, xgboost, urllib3, json, os, and warnings

The most recent versions of these modules will work
